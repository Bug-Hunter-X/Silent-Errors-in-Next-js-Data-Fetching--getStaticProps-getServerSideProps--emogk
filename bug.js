In Next.js, a subtle error can occur when using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` with dynamic routes and you don't handle the case where the data fetching fails. If the data fetching promise rejects, your page will show a blank screen or an error 500 without informative error messages.  This is because Next.js's error handling for these functions isn't always as explicit as one might expect.  For example, a network error during fetching could trigger this behavior.

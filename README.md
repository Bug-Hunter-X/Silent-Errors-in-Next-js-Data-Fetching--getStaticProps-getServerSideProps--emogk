# Silent Errors in Next.js Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Next.js applications: silent failures during data fetching in `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.  When data fetching fails (e.g., due to network issues or API errors), the application might not display helpful error messages, leading to a frustrating user experience.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases a Next.js page that attempts to fetch data.  If the data fetch fails, no error is explicitly displayed; instead, the user sees a blank page or a generic 500 error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle data fetching errors using `try...catch` blocks.  This ensures that informative error messages are displayed to the user, improving the application's robustness and the debugging process.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the behavior of the two example pages.
